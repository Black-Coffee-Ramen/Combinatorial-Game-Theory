# Tic Tac Toe - an overview

This C programme creates a two-player Tic Tac 
Toe game. Functions that print the game board, verify for a winning condition, and determine whether the board is full are defined in the code. The main function starts the game, asks for the names of the players, then repeatedly requests moves from them until one of them wins or the board is filled.
